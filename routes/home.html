  <h3>Welcome to my capstone brochure! I am planning on creating a book club app.</h3>
  <h3>Users will be able to create book clubs - they can be physical book clubs or remote book clubs.</h3>
  <h3>To help users find the perfect book for their next book club, I will access the GoodReads API.</h3>
  <h3>Users will be able to create events for the book clubs.</h3>
